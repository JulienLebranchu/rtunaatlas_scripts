Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :


These data are basically data obtained from sampling a portion of the individual fishing operations of a given fishery in a specified period of time. In its general form, task 2 catch-and-effort (T2CE) is defined as: “The complete species (tuna, tuna like species and sharks) catch composition (in weight <kg> or/and in number of fish) obtained by a given amount of effort (absolute value) in a given stratification or detail level (stratum)”. The stratification level defines the “specific form” of T2CE. The ICCAT's Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) requires that T2CE data be submitted every year by fleet and gear, with at least the following time/area stratification level:

Time: month
Area: 1x1 degree squares (all surface gears); 5x5 degree squares (longline gears).

Finer temporal or spatial strata can be used. In particular, a T2CE record can be as detailed as a daily fishing operation of a vessel (e.g.: longline set of individual vessels - any reference to a vessel is always removed in order to preserve confidentiality. In some cases, T2CE records are as aggregated as a month's catch composition for an entire country and gear in a large geographical zone (e.g.: 20x20 square); such records, however, do not conform to SCRS requirements.

The species catch coverage (proportion of the overall Task I catch represented by T2CE) can range from a minimum of 5% to almost 100% depending on many factors. The stratification level currently available in the entire T2CE database (1950 to 2007) is very heterogeneous.

Time stratification is usually required by month but a considerable portion of available T2CE is by quarter or year.

Area stratification can go from 1x1 degree squares to large geographical regions (see square types in: http://www.iccat.int/Forms/CODES_SquareTypes.xls).

In many datasets, there may be misreporting ofthe entire species composition (where by-catch species may be underrepresented) obtained by a given effort amount of fishing effort.

Various datasets have already extrapolated (raised) species catches to the overall Task I catch, such that the original sampling coverage cannot be determined.

In some datasets, the effort is “double counted”. This occurs when, for the same fishery, more than one dataset with partial species catch compositions (often stratified differently) is reported to ICCAT through separate data submissions.",2017-11-20,2018-04-26,,,https://www.iccat.int/en/accesingdb.html,https://www.iccat.int/Data/t2ce_20171120.zip,https://www.iccat.int/Data/t2ce-ENG.pdf,,ICCAT,"step1: The dataset was downloaded on the %date_download% at this URL: %relation_source_dataset% reached through this web page: %relation_source_download%

Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :

This table lists catch in weight (purse seine) and/or numbers of fish (longline) of tuna and tuna-like species, preferably raised to the total nominal catch and fishing effort by month, species and gear. The maximum spatial aggregation should be by 1°x1° grid area for purse seine and 5°x5° grid area for longline. This is not, however, the case with all CE data available: CE data recorded for most artisanal fleets refers to irregular areas (e.g. CE data recorded per port of unloading).
Catches and effort are not available for all Nominal catches strata. When recorded, the catches in these datasets might represent the total catches of the species in the year for the fleet and gear concerned or represent simply a sample of those.
These data, as well as the length-frequency data listed below are considered to be in the public domain, provided that the catch of no individual vessel can be identified within a time/area stratum. In cases when an individual vessel can be identified, the data are aggregated prior to release by time, area or flag to preclude such identification, and will then be in the public domain.
Catch-and-effort and length-frequency data grouped at a finer level of time-area stratification are only released with written authorization from the sources of the data and are subject to a number of constraints destined to preserve confidentiality.
CE data are available in text (CSV) format. Please, refer to the detailed CE reference if you want to use this dataset.

It corresponds to the effort part of the IOTC catch-and-effort (task2) dataset.

Efforts are expressed in several units : Number of days at sea, number of fishing days, number of hooks, number of sets.

This table lists catch in weight (purse seine) and/or numbers of fish (longline) of tuna and tuna-like species, preferably raised to the total nominal catch and fishing effort by month, species and gear. The maximum spatial aggregation should be by 1°x1° grid area for purse seine and 5°x5° grid area for longline. This is not, however, the case with all CE data available: CE data recorded for most artisanal fleets refers to irregular areas (e.g. CE data recorded per port of unloading).
Catches and effort are not available for all Nominal catches strata. When recorded, the catches in these datasets might represent the total catches of the species in the year for the fleet and gear concerned or represent simply a sample of those.
These data, as well as the length-frequency data listed below are considered to be in the public domain, provided that the catch of no individual vessel can be identified within a time/area stratum. In cases when an individual vessel can be identified, the data are aggregated prior to release by time, area or flag to preclude such identification, and will then be in the public domain.
Catch-and-effort and length-frequency data grouped at a finer level of time-area stratification are only released with written authorization from the sources of the data and are subject to a number of constraints destined to preserve confidentiality.

Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :

Nominal catch datasets for stock assessments should be accessed through the dedicated meeting page for the IOTC working party.

This table lists annual catches for each IOTC statistical area, by species and fishing gear made by vessels flying the flag of the reporting country in live weight equivalent. These data are aggregated by calendar year for tuna and tuna-like species and non-target species (by-catch). The data set extends back to the 1950’s when industrial longlining started in the Indian Ocean. The data are in the public domain. Nominal catches are available in spreadsheet format (Microsoft excel) both for IOTC species and sharks. Please, refer to the worksheet NOTES within the downloadable spreadsheet if you want to use this dataset.

Note that the catch estimates in this data file differ from the ‘best scientific estimates’ of nominal catch used for stock assessment purposes and published on the dedicated meeting pages for each IOTC Working Party.  The best scientific estimates disaggregates catches recorded under species or gear aggregates recorded in the IOTC database reported by countries, which are then assigned by species or gear when the Secretariat has access to alternate sources of information such as statistical publications, fishery bulletins or other information.  For this reason, catches by individual species or gear published on the IOTC meeting pages may differ from the nominal catches available from the data file available here.

The description below is extracted from the CCSBT web page where the dataset has been downloaded.


Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :

It should be noted that the data for individual Flag States and fishing entities available here may differ to data that they provided to other organisations. This is in part due to the data manipulations conducted by the CCSBT in producing this dataset (a variety of data sources were used, requiring a range of correction and raising techniques) and in part due to differences in the data provided by individual Flag States and fishing entities to the CCSBT and to other organisations. In particular, the post 1994 SBT data provided by Japan to the CCSBT differs from the post 1994 SBT data that Japan provides to other regional fishery management organisations. The data that Japan provides to CCSBT takes advantage of a Real Time Monitoring Program for SBT to collect daily catch and effort reports from SBT targeting fishing vessels and this is considered to minimise the time lag in availability of the Japanese SBT log book data.

It should also be noted that the catch data provided here do not cover the full time-series of SBT fishing by each Flag State and fishing entity, nor do they contain the entire SBT catch for any year. In addition, prior to 1996, the SBT catch reported here for the Fishing Entity of Taiwan has been estimated from mixed bluefin tuna (species not reported separately) data. The reason for incomplete time series is that the catch and effort data is compiled from vessel logbooks or similar detailed records that may not have been collected throughout a nations fishing history. Similarly, in some years, there may not be complete coverage of a particular fleet by catch and effort data collection systems.

It should be further noted that in cases where information on the number of vessels has been provided to the Secretariat, the subsets provided here are made up of observations with a minimum of three vessels per strata. This is due to the CCSBT confidentiality rules.

For some CCSBT Members, the data provided here are not restricted to fishing that targeted SBT. Instead, the data represents all purse seine and pole & line fishing in which catches of SBT were feasible. This includes fishing that targeted SBT, fishing that targeted other tuna or tuna like species, and/or fishing conducted in strata (year/month/area) where SBT were also taken. As a consequence, there are many fishing records with no SBT catch. Note: the extent to which fishing effort associated with past unreported catches has been reported is currently unknown.

Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :

It should be noted that the data for individual Flag States and fishing entities available here may differ to data that they provided to other organisations. This is in part due to the data manipulations conducted by the CCSBT in producing this dataset (a variety of data sources were used, requiring a range of correction and raising techniques) and in part due to differences in the data provided by individual Flag States and fishing entities to the CCSBT and to other organisations. In particular, the post 1994 SBT data provided by Japan to the CCSBT differs from the post 1994 SBT data that Japan provides to other regional fishery management organisations. The data that Japan provides to CCSBT takes advantage of a Real Time Monitoring Program for SBT to collect daily catch and effort reports from SBT targeting fishing vessels and this is considered to minimise the time lag in availability of the Japanese SBT log book data.

It should also be noted that the effort data provided here do not cover the full time-series of SBT fishing by each Flag State and fishing entity, nor do they contain the entire fishing effort targeting SBT for any year. The reason for incomplete time series is that the catch and effort data is compiled from vessel logbooks or similar detailed records that may not have been collected throughout a nations fishing history. Similarly, in some years, there may not be complete coverage of a particular fleet by catch and effort data collection systems.

It should be further noted that in cases where information on the number of vessels has been provided to the Secretariat, the subsets provided here are made up of observations with a minimum of three vessels per strata. This is due to the CCSBT confidentiality rules.

Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :

The tables of catch statistics cover the main commercial tuna and billfish species caught in the region: albacore (Thunnus alalunga), bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), black marlin (Makaira indica), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The WCFPC, through their member countries, are now obliged to compile estimates of key shark species, some of which are now covered in the longline fleet tables: blue shark (Prionace glauca), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and mako sharks (Isurus spp.). Catches of other species are not covered explicitly, and discards are not considered.

The main industrial fishing methods employed in the WCPFC region include longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and troll. The domestic fisheries of Indonesia and the Philippines employ several other methods. Driftnet fishing for albacore in the South Pacific Ocean ceased in 1991. Individual fleets presented herein cover vessels that are flagged to that nation and those vessels considered to be 'chartered' according to the WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure (CMM-2012-05) on Charter Notification.

For the purse-seine fishery, recent studies using observer data (e.g. Lawson, 2007, Lawson, 2010, Lawson, 2012, Lawson, 2013, Lawson, 2014, Hampton and Williams, 2011, Hampton and Williams, 2015) show that the logsheet-reported catch, mainly for associated sets, should contain higher quantities of yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have been misreported as skipjack tuna. Purse-seine catch estimates that have been adjusted with species compositions determined from observer grab samples corrected for size selectivity bias (see Lawson, 2010, Lawson, 2012, Lawson, 2013, and Lawson, 2014) are presented herein as the best available WCFPC purse-seine catch estimates for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna. All composite tables and figures referring to purse-seine species catch are consistent with these estimates. The estimates of purse seine catch by species may differ from the original estimates provided by WCPFC member countries for their fleets, but total purse seine catch will not differ. The purse seine species catch estimates are produced from statistical models and will therefore change from year to year as more data become available.

For the longline fishery, estimates of key shark species have improved in recent years but for most fleets remain uncertain due to (i) clear under-reporting of catches, or (ii) very low coverage of observer data used to estimate these catches.

The tables of annual catch estimates for individual fleets cover those years during which the fleet is known to have fished; the lack of recent years in a table implies that the fleet has ceased fishing.

The sources of the estimates are available from the SPC Oceanic Fisheries Programme.",,2018-04-26,,,https://www.wcpfc.int/folder/statistical-bulletins,https://www.wcpfc.int/system/files/YEARBOOK_2016_XLS.zip,https://www.wcpfc.int/statistical-bulletins,,WCPFC,"step1: The dataset was downloaded on the %date_download% at this URL: %relation_source_dataset% reached through this web page: %relation_source_download% .
