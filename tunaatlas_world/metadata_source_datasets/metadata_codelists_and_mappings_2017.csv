b) each quadrangle (rectangle) should be identified by its graticule-based boundaries as defined by the latitude and the longitude meeting in its corner nearest to the point where the Equator is crossed by the Greenwich Meridian;

c) the foregoing data on latitude and longitude should be preceded by (i) the first digit identifying the size of the quadrangle and then by (ii) a second digit indicating the quadrant of the globe in which the quadrangle is located.
